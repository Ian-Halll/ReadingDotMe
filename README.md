## Installation
The code can be downloaded or cloned from the public repository at https://github.com/Ian-Halll/ReadingDotMe.  Once the code is installed, it will be vital to ensure that you have node.js downloaded, so the necessary dependencies can be installed.  Once you have ensured node.js is installed, you can run npm I in the root directory of the project to install the necessary dependencies.
      
## Usage
The README generator is invoked by running the command "Node index.js" in the project's root directory, from there, the user will be prompted about their project title, description, a table of contents template, installation, usage, credits, license, and contact information.  Once each prompt has been answered, the generator will write a README.MD file in the root directory of the project, tailored to the user's specifications
